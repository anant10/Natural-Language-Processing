###Note: I have mistakenly created two repositories from two different github account. Please consider this repository for grading and ignore the other repository "ps1-anant10".

In this repository, there are two colab files, each of which contains half the assignment and its relevant instructions. 

Starting with PS1_Reviews, please complete the two files according to the instructions in each of them. 

Note that in order to save your edits to these files, you may need to use the "Save as copy in github" function in Google Colab, in the File menu.

Feedback:
100/100, well done
